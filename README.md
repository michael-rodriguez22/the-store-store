# the-store-store
This is an E-commerce platform built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This application was built initially by passing state through components as props. I then implemented a global state using the React Context API. Lastly, I reconfigured the application to use Redux in place of the Context API.
